# Review questions
# 1, Write a square function. (e,g: in: 9 -> out: 3)

# 2, Create a list.
#   a - Adds a new item to the end of a list
#   b - Inserts an item at the ùëñth position in a list
#   c - Removes and returns the last item in a list
#   d - Removes and returns the ùëñth item in a list
#   e - Modifies a list to be sorted
#   f - Modifies a list to be in reverse order
#   g - Deletes the item in the 3rd position
#   h - Returns the index of the first occurrence of item
#   i - Returns the number of occurrences of item
#   j - Removes the first occurrence of item
#   k - Access to the 2nd element of a sequence
#   l - Combine sequences together
#   m - Concatenate a repeated number of times
#   n - Ask whether an item is in a sequence
#   o - Ask the number of items in the sequence
#   p - Extract a part of a sequence

# 3, Write a square_root function
# (e,g : input-> 9 output-> 3)
# Hint : Use the Euclid's Algorithm

# 4, Write a Infinite Monkey Theorem
# The sentence we‚Äôll shoot for is: ‚Äúmethinks it is like a weasel‚Äù
# 1 - Write a function that generates a string that is 27 characters long by choosing random letters from the 26 letters in the alphabet plus the space.
# 2 - Write another function that will score each generated string by comparing the randomly generated string to the goal.
# 3 - Write a function will repeatedly call generate and score, then if 100% of the letters are correct we are done.
#     If the letters are not correct then we will generate a whole new string.
#

# 5, See if you can improve upon the program in the self check by keeping letters that are correct and only modifying one character in the best string so far.
#    This is a type of algorithm in the class of ‚Äúhill climbing‚Äù algorithms, that is we only keep the result if it is better than the previous one.

# 6, Create a class (Name it Fraction)
#   a - Add initial value top and buttom.
#   b - Call the class and print it.
#   c - Write a show() method in the class.
#   d - Override __str__ method so it can print the fraction
#   e - Override __add__ method so it can concat the fraction
#
